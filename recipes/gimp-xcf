# Extracts Gimp's XCF file format
# 
# Requires: The GIMP, perl, and the Gimp perl module. Only tested on GIMP 2.x.
#
# You will find the "Gimp" module on CPAN or in your Linux/UNIX distribution.
# In GIMP 1.2 it's included with the gimp source.
#
# If your distribution doesn't include it, fire up the CPAN shell as root:
# $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
# You can probably skip the manual configuration.  In the CPAN shell, type:
# $ install Gimp
# This will install version 2 of the module, to match The GIMP version 2.

# To use this recipe you need to start the GIMP Perl Server.  Start up The GIMP
# and run it from the Xtns->Perl->Server menu (nothing will happen visually
# when clicking).  If that menu is not present, the plugin/module is probably
# not correctly installed. You can also start it from the command line:
# $ gimp --batch '(extension-perl-server 0 0 0)'
