# Extracts Microsoft's OLE container format, used by newer versions of
# Microsoft Office (>= Word 6.0) and old versions of StarOffice (<= 5.0). The
# format is documented at http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~schwartz/pmh/guide.html
#
# The files it extracts can be Word, Powerpoint, Excel or other interesting
# things, but many weird OLE fragments will be pulled out as well. All known
# formats are listed near the top of tools/ole_rename.pl.
# This recipe will NOT recover Microsoft Access files, WordPerfect files,
# OpenOffice.org files, or StarOffice >= 6.0 files.
# It will try to guess the file type, but if it fails to guess something you
# have identified manually, please send sample files to jbj@knef.dk.
#
# To recover files from OpenOffice.org or StarOffice >= 6.0, use the "zip"
# recipe instead (these files are just zip files with some xml content)
#
# Depends on perl: http://perl.com

# There must be at least 4 512-byte blocks: the header, a big block depot, the
