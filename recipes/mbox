command sed '/\x00\x00\x00/q' >"$1"

# sed streams throughput to $1 and matches three null bytes for a termination
# condition. On an undamaged mbox file, you could use a single null byte
# pattern match; however for the purposes of my particulat data recovery
# situation, I found three nulls to be useful for a recovery which satisfied my
# whim for larger and fewer recovered files.

# it will include non-printable chars which will result in a non-text file

# Other useful termination conditions may involve the use of non-printable
# chars which are illegal in mbox files, and may provide for a text file output
# if the data you are working from is undamaged: examples may include 
# command sed '/[\x00-\x09]/q' >"$1"
# command sed '/[\x0b-\x19]/q' >"$1"
# command sed '/[\x7f-\xff]/q' >"$1"
