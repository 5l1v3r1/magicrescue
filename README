Magic Rescue
------------

Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to recover and
calls an external program to extract them. It looks at "magic bytes" in file
contents, so it can be used both as an undelete utility and for recovering a
corrupted drive or partition. As long as the file data is there, it will find
it.

It works on any file system, but on very fragmented file systems it can only
recover the first chunk of each file. Practical experience (this program was
not written for fun) shows, however, that chunks of 30-50MB are not uncommon.

Building
--------

./configure && make && make install

Don't worry about it if all the files don't build, the most important thing is
that the magicrescue binary builds. You may want to run "make -k" and come back
later to build the problematic files only if you need them.

Using
-----

man magicrescue
